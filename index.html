            This was a good week, First i spent a lot of time making this site
            responive and also changing some styles here and there,
            Then i made a <a style="color: greenyellow;" href="https://github.com/plasticomega/calculator" target="_blank">calculator project</a>
            and also did some DSA type questions which i have found to be useful, I totally used to think they were useless and would never have any real world application but doing those questions helped me a lot with my calculator project.
